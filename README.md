Visualize the phenomena found in the Citi Bike Trip History logs


### Purpose

For this assignment I decided to focus on the beginning period of the pandemic. Like anu other means if transportation, the pandemic has affected Citi Bike in one way or another. But unlike other means of transportation, bike riding is an individual activity that prevents riders from close proximity. Keeping this advantage  in mind, the citi bike has an upper hand in the transportation industry. According to the website [fortune](https://fortune.com/2020/06/15/bicycles-coronavirus-cities-lime-citi-bike/), the ride volume grew by 67% in early March. This suggests the potential of growth at larger scale in the future. Therefore, the time between March of 2020 to April of 2020 will be of main focus in my analysis with answers to the following questions:

* What stations were the most active (start and end) during the month of March-April 2020?

* What was the most common start-end stations during the month of March-April 2020?

* Which age groups and gender were the most active during the month of March-April 2020?

* What was the busiest hours and for which age group during the month of March-April 2020?


### Extracting

The very first step is to extract the data from the source. One way to do it is to download the files (csv files in this case) and the other way is using pandas and python. For this assignment the data were extracted from [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). All the process of extracting is described along with the code in the Data_Extracting.ipynb of this repo. 


### Cleaning

The next step was to clean the data so that any missing data or errors can be omitted for better results.
